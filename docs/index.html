            <!--            <strong> Purpose and how to use this document: </strong> <br>-->
            <strong> Purpose: </strong>This questionnaire is intended to help organisations understand their eligibility for grants under the Rapid Response Window (RRW). The Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund (WPHF) has launched a Rapid Response Window (RRW) to address the funding gap on women’s participation in formal peace processes and the implementation of peace agreements.
            <br><br>
            The WPHF RRW provides financing for strategic, short term and urgent services and initiatives led by women peacebuilders and women’s civil society organizations to increase women’s influence in national, subnational and international formal peace processes. The WPHF RRW does not support community-focused initiatives and is not intended to fund medium or long-term peacebuilding initiatives.
            <br><br>
            This new funding mechanism is open to formal peace processes in all ODA eligible countries with a track 1 or track 2 peace process or implementation of a peace agreement. See definitions of peace process, track 1, track 2 and implementation of peace agreement here.
            <br><br>
            <strong> How to use this document: </strong> Scroll down and click the first question (Is there a peace process?). An information box will appear, alongside the relevant options to choose from.

This is a somewhat distinct issue to consultations conducted after the agreement, for example, as part of fact-finding investigations into abuses during the conflict. Consultations can help negotiators to understand the causes of the conflict, public opinion about the prospect of negotiations or the ongoing negotiations, as well as the issues the group consulted would like to see in the peace agreement. Consultations can be conducted by some or all of the parties to the negotiations, by the mediator, by working groups or committees, or by outside actors such as observer missions. These consultations are often unofficial or conducted on an ad hoc basis; however, sometimes consultations are officially incorporated into the negotiation structure. <br> <br> </p>

                <p class="cards-paragraph-style"> <br> Instead of Comprehensive Peace Agreement negotiations, some states confronted with major armed conflict are opting for inclusive political dialogue processes that aim to address these issues without giving veto power to non-state armed groups. <br>

                    Other states have opted for political dialogue alone, in the hope the armed conflict will wither away when deprived of its animating grievances. These types of processes are currently not considered peace processes by the RRW for funding purposes.<br><br>
                    At the more organised end of the composite peace and transition process spectrum, we find processes that strategically divide the major issues at stake in the conflict into packages or “tracks”, and split these among different forums, usually featuring different parties.<br>

                    Second, non-state armed actors often conclude peace agreements amongst themselves. These generally look quite different to national peace agreements and may look more like elaborate ceasefire agreements than programs of major political reform.
